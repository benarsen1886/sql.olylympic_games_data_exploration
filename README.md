SQL has over the years become one of the most important and widely used programming language in the world used . SQL is widely used by Data Analysts, Quality Analysts, Business Analysts, Data Engineers, Data Scientist etc. to solve business problems.

My first encounter with SQL started on YouTube when i decided to learn by myself. I later got in-depth and hands-on experience when i enrolled in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. During the programme, I gained an understanding of querying a database, using joins to pull data from multiple tables, use aggregate functions and how to complete calculations using SQL queries.

I will be putting my skills to use as I dive deep to explore 120 years of the Olympic games, Athens 1896 to Rio 2016.

The Data

The data for the purpose of the work was downloaded from kaggle which has been put together by Rgriffin. The dataset can be found and downloaded here.

Getting to work
I downloaded the data which contained two files which i renamed Olympic history and countries respectively. The file olympic_history.csv contains 271116 rows and 15 columns. The columns include: ID — Unique number for each athlete, Name: Athlete’s name, Sex : M or F, Age: Integer. Height : In centimetres, Weight: In kilograms, Team: Team name, NOC: National Olympic Committee 3-letter code, Games: Year and season, Year : Integer, Season: Summer or Winter, City: Host city, Sport: Sport, Event: Event, Medal: Gold, Silver, Bronze, or NA.
